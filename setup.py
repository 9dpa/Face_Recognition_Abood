"Welcome to AbdurHman adel Program"
"For our study in multimedia, we learned a lot from offices and how to deal
" with them. My project now is a program that identifies people and
" knows them through a computer camera."
"If we store some pictures of the people we want to know in a 
"special folder and name these pictures with the names of the
" people as a kind of storage for their names.
"His office has used face recognition
"What distinguishes this library from others is that the ability to distinguish in it reaches 99%
"
"


"AND I user 3 pyhton files :
"First : Image Compression -> This file compares one image with another so that it can 
"bring the features of the face, differentiate and identify the person.

"Secound : Main_Vedio -> This file performs the conditional Encode check of the function
" in order to fetch the class file and the comparison file, and then it fulfills the condition.

"Theard : Simple Faces - > they do 
"1- Resize frame for a faster speed.
"2-then Load Images
"3-Store image encoding and names
"4-Get the filename only from the initial file path.
"5-Store file name and file encoding
"6-Find all the faces and face encodings in the current frame of video
"Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color 
"(which face_recognition uses
"7-See if the face is a match for the known face(s)
"8-Convert to numpy array to adjust coordinates with frame resizing quickly
